3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
    - It's good practice to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    - On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

5. **Install Dependencies:**
    - Install the required Python packages.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. **Run the Project:**
    - Execute your main Python script or the entry point for your application.
    ```bash
    python your_main_script.py
    ```

7. **Access the Project:**
    - Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (or any other relevant URL or port if applicable) to access your project.

8. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment (Optional):**
    - Once you're done using the project, deactivate the virtual environment.
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

## Notes:
- If your project requires specific configurations, settings, or additional steps, please provide them here.
